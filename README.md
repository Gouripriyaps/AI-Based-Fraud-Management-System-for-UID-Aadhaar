# AI-Based-Fraud-Management-System-for-UID-Aadhaar
1. Project Overview

Document Upload: Users upload an Aadhaar document image.

Classification Model: Automatically identifies the type of document to ensure it is processed correctly.

Object Detection: Detects and extracts key sections (e.g., name, address, UID) from the document for further analysis.

OCR (Optical Character Recognition): Extracts text from the detected sections to produce raw data.

Matching Logic: Compares the extracted details against database records to detect mismatches or potential fraud.

2. Core Components and Model Options

2.1 Document Classification

Recommended Models:

EfficientNet: Lightweight and fast, suitable for resource-constrained environments.

ResNet: High accuracy, ideal for more demanding classification tasks.

Purpose:

Verifies that the uploaded document is an Aadhaar card before proceeding.

2.2 Detection Model

Recommended Models:

YOLOv8 or YOLOv9: Advanced object detection models known for their speed and accuracy in real-time scenarios.

Alternative Models:

Faster R-CNN: Offers higher accuracy but operates at a slower speed.

SSD (Single Shot Detector): Balances speed and accuracy effectively.

Purpose:

Detects and extracts bounding boxes for key sections of the Aadhaar document, such as:

Name

Address

UID

Date of Birth

Phone Number

2.3 OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

Recommended Tools:

Tesseract OCR: Open-source, customizable solution suitable for basic text extraction.

Google Vision API or AWS Textract: High accuracy, especially for documents with complex layouts, but requires API setup and incurs additional costs.

Purpose:

Converts the text within the detected sections into digital format for further analysis.

3. Matching and Verification Logic

3.1 Name Matching

Methods:

Exact string match.

Phonetic similarity algorithms (e.g., Levenshtein Distance, Soundex).

3.2 Address Matching

Approach:

Decompose the address into smaller components (e.g., street name, city, pincode).

Match each component separately to account for minor variations.

3.3 UID Matching

Requirement:

Exact match is mandatory to ensure data integrity and detect inconsistencies.

3.4 Date of Birth (DOB) and Phone Number Matching

Method:

Use an exact match for both DOB and phone number as these are critical identifiers.
